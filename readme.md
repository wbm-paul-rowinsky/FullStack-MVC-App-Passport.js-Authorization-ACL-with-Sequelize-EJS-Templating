Title:
Full-Stack MVC Application with Passport.js Authorization, ACL with Sequelize, and EJS Modules

Description:

Welcome to the repository for a full-stack MVC web application built with Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js for authentication, Access Control List (ACL) using Sequelize ORM for database management (MySQL), and EJS for server-side templating.

Features:

MVC Architecture:

Utilization of the MVC design pattern for organizing code into separate models, views, and controllers, enhancing code maintainability and scalability.

User Authentication with Passport.js:

Integration of Passport.js for authentication with various strategies such as local authentication (username/password), OAuth, and others.
Secure user authentication and session management to ensure user privacy and data security.

Access Control List (ACL) with Sequelize:

Implementation of Access Control List (ACL) using Sequelize ORM to manage user permissions and access rights within the application.
Fine-grained control over user roles and permissions, allowing for customized authorization rules for different parts of the application.

Server-Side Templating with EJS:

Integration of EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as the server-side templating engine for generating dynamic HTML content based on data from the server.
Creation of reusable view components and layouts using EJS partials and includes, enhancing code reusability and maintainability.

Full-Stack Development:

Development of both front-end and back-end components using JavaScript and HTML/CSS.
Implementation of dynamic client-side interactions using JavaScript frameworks/libraries like React.js, Angular, or Vue.js (optional).

Usage:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Create a database on a MySQL server (you can use the default data from the schoolacl.sql file, import this file into PhpMyAdmin to create a database on your MySQL server).
- Install dependencies using npm install.
- Configure environment variables for database connection, OAuth keys/secrets, and session management.
- Run the application using npm start or node server.js.
- Access the application through the specified port (default: 3010) in your web browser.
